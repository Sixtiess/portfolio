    <h1>Liam Hickey's CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
    <p>I have always loved math and science. They provide me with a way to describe and understand the world in a level of detail that words could never do. I like writing code that can help me do something, like calculators or drawing tools. Also, I have spent many hours playing video games, and using code to create my own is a very rewarding experience. </p>
